Currently, if you change a label, the system will trigger the same event as if a new label had been created. Please keep this in mind.
We will update this page if in the future we can distinguish between new labels and updates to existing labels.

### [hashtag](https://support.whapi.cloud/help-desk/receiving/webhooks/incoming-webhooks-format/other/labels\#label-is-assigned-to-chat)    Label is assigned to chat

Use the `chats.patch` setting to get this webhook. Note that chats.patch sends notifications putting in the callback information that was there before the entity was updated and after the entity was updated, showing the difference and what has changed. We have described this in more detail here: [Webhook Events and Update Types (POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE)](https://support.whapi.cloud/help-desk/receiving/webhooks/detailed-webhook-settings#webhook-events-and-update-types-post-put-patch-delete)

Pay attention to the information that has been updated in the `changes` array.
