Please update the channel card and add the QR Authorization flow as below.
________________________________________
1) Channel card adjustments
•	Show Channel Token in full (no truncation).
o	Field: channel_token (value returned by WHAPI on create/confirm).
o	Add a small Copy icon next to it.
Layout example (all visible):
•	Channel Ref: channel_ref
•	Channel Token: xxxxxxxx… → show the entire string
•	WhatsApp Number: whatsapp_number
•	Status badges: status, auth_status
•	Created At, Stopped
________________________________________
2) Add “QR Authorization” action (channel linking)
•	Button label: “Show QR Code”
•	Enable only when:
o	status === 'ACTIVE'
o	channel not expired (time now < expires_at)
•	Disable (with tooltip) when:
o	no days available / expired (user must extend first)
API call (use CHANNEL token, not partner token)
GET https://gate.whapi.cloud/users/login?wakeup=true
Headers:
  accept: application/json
  authorization: Bearer {channel_token}   // <-- IMPORTANT
Expected response
{
  "status": "OK",
  "expire": 60,
  "base64": "data:image/png;base64,...."
}
UI behavior
•	Open a modal with:
o	the QR image (base64)
o	a 60-second countdown using the expire value
o	Refresh QR button that re-calls the same endpoint (using the same channel token)
o	helper text: “Open WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices → Link a device, then scan this QR”
•	On successful scan (poll channel state or let user confirm):
o	set auth_status = 'AUTHORIZED'
o	set stopped = false
o	keep status = 'ACTIVE' (unchanged)
o	show toast: “Channel connected successfully and now active.”
(If you already have a polling endpoint for channel state, reuse it; otherwise, leave the ‘Close’ button and user can re-open to refresh.)
Error handling
•	If the API returns an error, show the actual WHAPI error text in the toast.
•	If token is invalid/expired, instruct the admin to re-confirm the channel from WHAPI or re-create.
________________________________________
3) Security note
•	This QR endpoint must use the per-channel token (the string we save in channel_token).
•	Do not send the partner token here. The partner token is only for admin operations (create, extend, delete).
________________________________________
4) Acceptance criteria
•	Channel token is fully visible and copyable on the card.
•	“Show QR Code” opens a modal with the QR and a working 60s countdown.
•	“Refresh QR” re-fetches and updates the image + timer.
•	After scanning, auth_status updates to AUTHORIZED, and the success toast appears.
•	Button is disabled when there are 0 days or expired, with a tooltip to extend days.
