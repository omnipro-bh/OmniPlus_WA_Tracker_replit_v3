i need to check if possible to add **Data Collection** option in the workflow nodes (similar to the attached WhatsApp example)?

### What we need

We want a node that starts a **data-collection sequence** and collects user inputs step-by-step (date, time, full name, phone, CPR, choices, etc.).

But **nothing should be saved permanently until the user reaches the end and clicks “Save”.**
If the user doesn’t click Save (or clicks Stop/Cancel), then **all collected values should be discarded**.

### Key behavior (important)

1. **Start marker / start node**

   * In the workflow, we need to define where the collection starts (a dedicated node that begins the collection flow).

2. **Collect answers into a temporary “draft”**

   * Each step stores the value into a temporary session object (draft), not the database.
   * Support multiple input types:

     * text
     * phone number
     * number
     * date (DD/MM/YYYY)
     * time (3PM / 03PM / 3 format)
     * single-select options (buttons/list)

3. **End screen + confirmation**

   * At the end, show a **summary**: “Please confirm info below…”
   * Provide 2 actions:

     * ✅ **Save** → commits ALL draft fields (persist), and then continues the workflow
     * ❌ **Stop/Cancel** → discards everything (no saving), and routes to a cancel path

4. **Validation**

   * Each field can have validation rules (required, regex, min/max, date format, etc.)
   * If invalid, re-ask the same step with an error hint.

### Workflow builder UI suggestion

A single node like **“Data Collection”** with:

* A list of fields (each field: label, prompt text, variable key, type, validation)
* Save button label + Cancel button label
* Next route after Save + route after Cancel

### Acceptance criteria

* Values are NOT persisted until Save is clicked.
* Save commits the full bundle in one go (atomic).
* Cancel/Stop leaves no partial data saved.
* Works per-user session (multiple users simultaneously).

i need to collect all these information in new menu tap called " Data collection " or "Capture list", 

we need to have a way to see each sequence of data collection, because i might multiple data collection in the same workflow or in different workflow. 


dont do changes, just give your best suggestion to achieve this option
