Requirements Summary
When creating or editing a plan in the Admin panel:
1. Payment Methods (PayPal / Offline)
•	PayPal and Offline should be two separate selectable options, not grouped.
•	Admin can choose:
o	✅ PayPal only
o	✅ Offline only
o	✅ Both together
•	This replaces the old “Paid (PayPal + Offline)” combined selection.
•	Each plan must allow one or both methods.
2. PayPal Plan ID Requirement
•	For PayPal-enabled plans:
o	A new input field should appear called “PayPal Plan ID”.
o	The field is mandatory if PayPal is selected.
o	If the PayPal Plan ID is not provided, the plan will not be activated or published.
o	The system should show a clear validation message:
“Please insert the PayPal Plan ID to activate PayPal payment for this plan.”

3. Daily Bulk Messages Limit (Updated Behavior)
•	Rename “Bulk Messages Limit” to “Daily Bulk Messages Limit”.
•	This limit enforces how many bulk campaigns a user can run per day.
•	Even if a user tries to insert or send campaigns that exceed the daily limit:
o	The system must notify the user:
“You have reached your daily bulk message limit for today. Please try again tomorrow.”
•	The system should reset the daily bulk message counter every 24 hours, based on the user’s subscribed plan.
•	This daily enforcement is strict — it must reset automatically and not allow over-limit sending.

4. Workflow (Chatbot) Limit
•	Rename “Chatbots Limit (optional)” to “Workflow (Chatbot) Limit”.
•	This limit defines how many workflows (chatbots) a user can create under their current plan.
•	The system must enforce this limit strictly:
o	If a user tries to create more workflows than allowed, show a notification:
“You have reached your workflow (chatbot) creation limit for your plan.”
•	The system must prevent saving or adding any new workflow once the limit is reached.
•	Admin should be able to view and edit this limit per plan.

6. Enforcement Logic Summary
•	✅ If PayPal selected but Plan ID missing → plan cannot be activated.
•	✅ If Offline selected only → PayPal ID field hidden.
•	✅ Daily Bulk Message Limit → enforced daily, auto-reset every 24 hours.
•	✅ Workflow (Chatbot) Limit → enforced on workflow creation.
•	✅ Admin can still change any limit values later.
•	✅ Limits should be stored in plan JSON structure as:
•	{
•	  "daily_single_messages_limit": 1000,
•	  "daily_bulk_messages_limit": 300,
•	  "workflow_chatbots_limit": 5,
•	  "channels_allowed": 2
•	}

7. Plan Behavior Recap
•	PayPal: Requires valid PayPal Plan ID to activate; user subscriptions auto-start when payment succeeds.
•	Offline: Starts only when admin manually adds days after approving payment.
•	Both: User sees both buttons (PayPal + Offline).
•	Daily Bulk Messages: Daily limit enforced and reset automatically every 24 hours.
•	Workflow (Chatbot) Limit: Restricts the number of workflows a user can create; enforced by system.

8. Validation Messages
Condition	Message

Exceeded daily bulk messages	“You have reached your daily bulk message limit for today. Please try again tomorrow.”
Exceeded workflow/chatbot limit	“You have reached your workflow (chatbot) creation limit for your plan.”

9. Data Saving
•	Save all limits and selected payment methods under the plans table.
•	Add new column paypal_plan_id (nullable, required if PayPal selected).
•	Add field payment_methods as array:
Example: ["paypal"], ["offline"], or ["paypal","offline"].
