If your number doesn't show significant activity, it's worth introducing this activity gradually. [To warm up the number](https://support.whapi.cloud/help-desk/blocking/warming-up-new-phone-numbers-for-whatsapp-api), we recommend paying attention to these important metrics ( _Instructions for launching:_ [Automatic warm-up module](https://support.whapi.cloud/help-desk/tools/automatic-warm-up-module))

You can only update your scores once a day!

### [Direct link to heading](https://support.whapi.cloud/help-desk/tools/whatsapp-activity-safety-meter\#metrics)    Metrics

- **Lifetime of phone number**: Older numbers have the opportunity to be more active with less risk. Recently registered numbers are more closely monitored by WhatsApp. If you are planning mass activity, you should first take care of warming up the number;

- **Coverage of the address book**: WhatsApp flags activity by interacting with unfamiliar contacts. Engage with your target audience and encourage your clients to add you to their contacts;

- **Response rate**: A higher response rate indicates a healthy engagement with your audience. A low response rate may signal to WhatsApp that your activity looks like spam;
