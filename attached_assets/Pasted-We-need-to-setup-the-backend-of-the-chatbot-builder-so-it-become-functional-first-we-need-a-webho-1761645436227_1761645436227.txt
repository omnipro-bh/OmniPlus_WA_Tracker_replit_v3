We need to setup the backend of the chatbot builder so it become functional, 

first we need a webhook that receives all incoming messages, to receive all Incoming Messages for the channel created/active
What the webhook receives
•	phone (sender)
•	message_type: text or button_reply
•	text (if message_type = text)
•	button_id (if message_type = button_reply)
________________________________________
Decision flow (simple)
1.	Receive incoming message (webhook)
2.	If message_type = text:
o	Check: “Is this the first message today from this phone?”
	Yes → Send the Welcome/Greeting message (this message is configured inside the chatbot builder).
	No → Do nothing further.
3.	If message_type = button_reply:
o	Read button_id.
o	Find which block in the chatbot builder this button_id is linked to.
o	Send the message(s) of that block to the same phone.

        ├── Is message_type = text?
        │        │
        │        └── Yes → Is this the first message today for this phone?
        │                     │
        │                     ├── Yes → Send Welcome/Greeting (from builder)
        │                     └── No  → (optional) do nothing 
        │
        └── Is message_type = button_reply?
                 │
                 └── Yes → Get button_id → Lookup linked block in builder
                               → Send that block’s message(s)
________________________________________
Minimal data the system keeps
•	Last message date per phone (to know “first message of the day”)
•	Button map: button_id → next_block_id (exported from the builder)
________________________________________
Notes for Replit AI
•	The Welcome/Greeting content is managed in the builder (not hardcoded).
•	The button routing strictly follows the builder: each button has an ID that points to a block.
•	Keep it lightweight: just a webhook + a tiny store for “last message date per phone” + a lookup for buttons → blocks.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Since everything is based on incoming messages coming from webhook, we can keep one master webhook to received all incoming messages for all users in the app ( no recommended with high volume ) 

or the system generate separate webhook url for each user.

give me a plan of what you will do before you start coding, and any suggestion
