We recommend using UTF-16. To do this, you need to represent the character as a hexadecimal number or a surrogate pair, two hexadecimal numbers. These numbers are available in the [Unicode character table](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect/hex/1F63B).
For example: `\uD83D\uDE3B`

- Click the Unicode column value next to the selected emoticon.

- Then select the surrogate couples column

- To indicate that the text is Unicode (Unicode) encoded, enter a backslash with a lowercase Latin letter u ("\\u") before each hexadecimal number.
