Still the below is not implemented 

1) Node deletion
•	Requirement: Ability to delete nodes and their connections (currently only adding is possible).
•	Acceptance criteria:
o	Delete via keyboard (Del/Backspace) or right-click context menu.
o	Connected edges are removed cleanly.
o	Undo/redo handles deletion properly.
________________________________________
2) Horizontal linking layout
•	Requirement: Node connections should flow horizontally (left → right) rather than vertically.
•	Reason: Horizontal flow is more intuitive for chatbot sequences and easier to visualize message progression.
•	Acceptance criteria:
o	Default node placement and link rendering use a left-to-right structure.
o	Auto-arrange maintains horizontal spacing when adding or linking nodes.
________________________________________
3) Multi-output linking for buttons
•	Requirement: Each button message node should expose separate, labeled output ports for each button.
o	Example: If a node has 3 buttons, there should be 3 output connectors labeled with each button’s text or ID.
•	Acceptance criteria:
o	Each output port can be linked to a different node.
o	Labels are visible on the port itself for easy linking.
o	Renaming buttons updates their labels dynamically.

4) Webhook routing based on reply IDs
•	Context: The webhook receives incoming message payloads like:
•	"reply": {
•	  "type": "list_reply",
•	  "list_reply": { "id": "ListV3:r1" }
•	}
•	Go through the attached API documentation to understand better. 
•	Requirement:
o	Extract only the part after “:” (e.g., r1).
o	Match it with the node or port that has the same Button/Option ID.
o	Route execution to the linked node.
o	Respect userId, channelId, and token to isolate sessions.
•	Acceptance criteria:
o	Correct routing for button_reply and list_reply.
o	Unknown IDs trigger a fallback node.
o	Clean mapping between IDs and node links.
Routing logic (for reference):
const rawId = incoming.reply.list_reply?.id || incoming.reply.button_reply?.id;
const shortId = rawId?.split(':').pop();
const target = flow.findByOptionId(shortId, { userId, channelId });
if (target) execute(target.nextNodeId);
else execute(flow.fallbackNodeId);
